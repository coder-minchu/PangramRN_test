React Native Project

This is a new React Native project, bootstrapped using @react-native-community/cli.

Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions till the "Creating a new application" step.

Step 1: Clone the Project

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/coder-minchu/PangramRN_test.git

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install project dependencies:

cd PangramRN_test
npm install
# OR using Yarn
# yarn install

If you are using iOS, go to the ios folder and run:

cd ios
pod install

Running the App

Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

npm start
# OR using Yarn
# yarn start

Step 2: Start Your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android

npm run android
# OR using Yarn
# yarn android

For iOS

npm run ios
# OR using Yarn
# yarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Modifying Your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it:

1. Open `App.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

2. For Android: Press the R key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M on Windows and Linux or Cmd ⌘ + M on macOS) to see your changes!

3. For iOS: Hit Cmd ⌘ + R in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Hardcoded Login
